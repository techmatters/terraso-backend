# Partner soil-ID API access

How to call the Terraso soil-ID API as a partner, with runnable Python and
shell examples.

## How it works

Terraso soil-ID is an **HTTPS GraphQL API**, so you can call it from any
language — the examples in this directory (Python and shell) are just one way.

**Authentication.** The Terraso team supplies you with a long-lived _refresh
token_. You don't send that token on every request; instead you exchange it for
a short-lived _access token_, then send the access token as a
`Bearer` credential on each API call. When the access token expires, you
exchange the refresh token again for a new access token. (The example scripts do this
automatically and cache the access token for reuse.)

**Making a request.** You send a GraphQL `soilMatches` query with, at minimum, a
**latitude and longitude**. You may optionally include **soil data** — observational data about slope,
surface cracks, and, per depth interval, texture, rock-fragment volume, and
color. The response is a ranked set of soil matches with a variety of
information about each. **The more soil data you supply, the more accurate the
match.**

## Files

| File                        | Role                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `soil_id_query_params.json` | The lookup input (latitude/longitude + optional soil `data`). Edit this to change the query. |
| `soil_id_query.py`          | Python example (standard library only).                                                      |
| `soil_id_query.sh`          | Shell example (requires `curl` + `jq`). Same behavior as the Python script.                  |

Both scripts are equivalent — they run the query, automatically exchange your
refresh token for an access token when needed, cache that access token, and
print the result to stdout. Use whichever you prefer, or treat them as a
reference for your own implementation. By default they talk to
`https://api.terraso.org`.

## Setup

You should store the long-lived refresh token securely.
The sample script puts the refresh and access tokens in ~/secrets/terraso/tokens.json.
The scripts read the refresh and access tokens from this file and write the access token
back into it as `access_token`, and subsequent runs reuse it until it expires.

Reminder: do not overwrite your long-lived refresh token with a new shorter-lived token.

This is sample code only; depending on your specific needs, you may want to do something differently.
To set make the sample scripts work as-is, please do the following:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/secrets/terraso
cat > ~/secrets/terraso/tokens.json <<'EOF'
{ "refresh_token": "<your-partner-refresh-token>" }
EOF
chmod 600 ~/secrets/terraso/tokens.json
```

## Run

The response from both scripts (JSON) goes to **stdout** (clean for piping or a redirect);
status/progress messages go to **stderr**

```sh
python3 soil_id_query.py | jq             # or: ./soil_id_query.sh | jq
python3 soil_id_query.py > response.json  # save the response to a file
```

Each run:

1. Reads the cached `access_token` from the tokens file and POSTs the
   `soilMatches` query (requesting every available field) to `/graphql/`.
2. If the call is rejected because the access token is missing or expired, it
   exchanges the `refresh_token` at `/auth/tokens` for a fresh access token,
   **writes that token back to the tokens file**, and retries once.
3. Prints the response to stdout (status messages to stderr).

## Request fields

`soil_id_query_params.json` holds the variables for the query. Only `latitude` and
`longitude` are required; everything else is optional, and the more you supply
the more accurate the match. These are the only inputs the soil-ID algorithm
accepts — there are no other fields.

```json
{
    "latitude": -0.85497,
    "longitude": 36.84891,
    "data": {
        "slope": 0.5,
        "surfaceCracks": "NO_CRACKING",
        "depthDependentData": [
            {
                "depthInterval": { "start": 0, "end": 10 },
                "texture": "CLAY",
                "rockFragmentVolume": "VOLUME_0_1",
                "colorLAB": { "L": 20, "A": 30, "B": 40 }
            },
            {
                "depthInterval": { "start": 10, "end": 30 },
                "texture": "SANDY_LOAM",
                "rockFragmentVolume": "VOLUME_1_15",
                "colorMunsell": "7.5YR 5/4"
            },
            {
                "depthInterval": { "start": 30, "end": 50 },
                "texture": "CLAY_LOAM",
                "rockFragmentVolume": "VOLUME_15_35",
                "colorMunsellNumeric": { "hue": 20, "value": 4, "chroma": 3 }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The three depths above each use a different color form (CIELAB, Munsell string,
numeric Munsell) to illustrate the options — use whichever you have.

| Field                     | Required | Notes                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `latitude`, `longitude`   | yes      | Decimal degrees (WGS84). A location-only lookup with no `data` is valid. |
| `data.slope`              | no       | Slope, in percent.                                                       |
| `data.surfaceCracks`      | no       | Enum (see below).                                                        |
| `data.depthDependentData` | no       | A list — one object per depth interval; add as many as you have.         |

Each object in `data.depthDependentData`:

| Field                 | Required | Notes                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `depthInterval`       | yes      | `{ "start": <cm>, "end": <cm> }`.                                                            |
| `texture`             | no       | Enum (see below).                                                                            |
| `rockFragmentVolume`  | no       | Enum (see below).                                                                            |
| `colorLAB`            | no       | CIELAB color `{ "L": <float>, "A": <float>, "B": <float> }` — all three required if present. |
| `colorMunsell`        | no       | Munsell color as a string, e.g. `"7.5YR 5/4"` or `"N 5/"` (neutral).                         |
| `colorMunsellNumeric` | no       | Munsell color as numbers: `{ "hue": <0–100>, "value": <float>, "chroma": <float> }`.         |

**Color.** Provide it in whichever form you have. If you supply more than one,
only the **first present** form is used — priority is `colorLAB`, then
`colorMunsell`, then `colorMunsellNumeric` — and the others are ignored. If that
chosen form can't be converted to a known color (e.g. an out-of-gamut Munsell
value), the depth is treated as having no color; it does **not** fall back to
another form you supplied (the request still succeeds). **Most callers should
use the `colorMunsell` string form** (e.g. `"7.5YR 5/4"`); the numeric form below
exists mainly for data already stored that way.

**Numeric Munsell hue (`colorMunsellNumeric.hue`).** Only relevant if you use
the numeric form. The hue is a single number on a 0–100 scale: the ten Munsell
hue families in order, ten units each. Compute it as `family_index × 10 +
substep`, where `substep` is the number written before the family letters
(`2.5`, `5`, `7.5`, or `10`):

| Family | R   | YR  | Y   | GY  | G   | BG  | B   | PB  | P   | RP  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Index  | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |

Examples: `7.5YR → 1×10 + 7.5 = 17.5`; `10R → 0×10 + 10 = 10`;
`2.5Y → 2×10 + 2.5 = 22.5`; `10YR → 1×10 + 10 = 20`. For a neutral color, use the
string form (`"N 5/"`) or set `chroma` to `0`.

**Enum values**

- `surfaceCracks`: `NO_CRACKING`, `SURFACE_CRACKING_ONLY`, `DEEP_VERTICAL_CRACKS`.
- `texture`: `SAND`, `LOAMY_SAND`, `SANDY_LOAM`, `SILT_LOAM`, `SILT`, `LOAM`,
  `SANDY_CLAY_LOAM`, `SILTY_CLAY_LOAM`, `CLAY_LOAM`, `SANDY_CLAY`, `SILTY_CLAY`,
  `CLAY`.
- `rockFragmentVolume`: `VOLUME_0_1` (0–1%), `VOLUME_1_15` (1–15%),
  `VOLUME_15_35` (15–35%), `VOLUME_35_60` (35–60%), `VOLUME_60` (>60%).

## Notes

- **Keep tokens secret.** Treat both the refresh token and the access token as
  credentials: don't print or log them, don't commit them, and don't paste them
  into the JSON files in this directory. These examples keep them only in the
  tokens file (written `chmod 600`) and in memory — do the same in your own
  code.
- **Refresh-token rotation.** `/auth/tokens` returns a new `refresh_token`
  alongside the `access_token`. Keep using your _original_ long-lived refresh
  token; the examples deliberately preserve it rather than the rotated one.
- **Configuration.** `TERRASO_API_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.terraso.org`)
  is the only setting; the tokens-file path is fixed at
  `~/secrets/terraso/tokens.json`.
- **Result shape.** `soilMatches` returns either `SoilMatches` (with
  `dataRegion` and a ranked list of `matches`) or `SoilIdFailure` (with a
  `reason` such as `DATA_UNAVAILABLE`). Each match's `soilInfo.soilSeries`
  carries the soil `name` and `description`, plus `management` guidance on
  global (non-US) matches; locations in the US also populate the US-only fields
  (`slope`, `ecologicalSite`, `landCapabilityClass`). For background on what
  these fields mean, the LandPKS [JSON export guide](https://landpks.terraso.org/help/export-json/)
  describes similar fields — but treat it as a **glossary, not a structural
  reference**: the export uses a post-processed format that differs from this
  API's raw GraphQL response.
- **Inspecting a token (optional).** Purely for debugging or curiosity, you can
  paste a token into <https://jwt.io> to see its decoded contents — there's no
  need to do this for normal use. Hovering over the `exp` field shows when that
  token expires. (jwt.io decodes in your browser, but it's still a third-party
  site, so avoid pasting a token you consider sensitive.)
