    One of the key aspects of the Landscape Management is its nature of

    organized in groups (formal or informal). Some examples of groups
    involved in Landscape Management are: non-government organizations,
    Landscape Partnerships, government entities, indigenous groups,
    research groups, etc.

    A Group might have other subgroups associated. This association, on
    Terraso backend platform is made by the GroupAssociation model.
