Two of the major, deltas, mangrove systems and much of the sea grasses important for turtles and fish nursery grounds.\nThe reef has been part of the Fijian lifestyle for centuries, providing sustenance, protection and supports a diverse range of industries from fishing to tourism being the highest revenue earner for the past decade. The GSR is a test of the fine balance between development and resource management for Fiji.\n\n",

    "description": "The uMngeni Ecological Infrastructure Partnership (UEIP) is a partnership that was formally established in November 2013 upon signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by key organisations that are committed to finding ways of integrating ecological infrastructure solutions to support built infrastructure investments in addressing challenges of water security in the uMngeni catchment.  Growing population and economic development in the catchment have led the uMngeni system being unable to meet the demand for delivery of water services in the area. The partnership currently comprises over 20 organisations from national, provincial and local government departments, business and academic institutions as well as civil society. The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), as a co-founder of the UEIP, has been the centre of coordination for the partnership since its inception.

Two of the major, deltas, mangrove systems and much of the sea grasses important for turtles and fish nursery grounds.\nThe reef has been part of the Fijian lifestyle for centuries, providing sustenance, protection and supports a diverse range of industries from fishing to tourism being the highest revenue earner for the past decade.
